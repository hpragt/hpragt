Hi there ðŸ‘‹
[![Ask Me Anything !](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ask%20me-anything-1abc9c.svg)](mailto:hpragt_at_infodation.nl?subject=Ask%20me%20anything)


## Who am I?
Hi, I'm Hugo. 

I went tot [university of Twente]([url](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/master/programmes/business-information-technology/)) to study business administration and computer science in 1993

I'm good with [computers]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_MZ#/media/File:Sharp_MZ-700_(cropped).jpg)) and teached myself [Java]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_in_Java)) in 1998. Before that I did Qbasic and [assembly code]([url](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Z80_Assembly)).

I am passionate about my job and a creative solution finder.

I'm a generalist and not a specialist with a strong analytical trait. I love to exchange ideas and brainstorm with smart people but have less patience with talking when it leads no-where. 

I have 2 small boys and a wife who is a kindergarden teacher. 


## What do I do at INFOdation?
- I work in the R&D team to fill our pipeline with innovations and to push innovations to our teams and solutions
- I help customers as a consultant on management and C-level
- I work as an architect for several projects
- I coach people wanting to become an architect
- I write and redact the development processes we use ( ISMS)


## Who do I report to at INFOdation ?

Things used to be pretty informal in infodation NL and as such I dont feel I'm actually reporting to anybody.
Which means I am ultimately responsible for myself and all working on my instigation.


## Who reports to me at INFOdation?
Things used to be pretty informal in infodation NL and as such I dont feel people have to report to me.
I do try to give constructive feedback to the people I work with.


## Do you need me to do something? How should I be contacted?
[based on]([url](https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/knowledge-of-men/eisenhower-decision-matrix/)) 'urgent' and 'important'

When you feel something technical related is really important, then you can be pretty sure it is also important to me.

if something is urgent mention me in Teams, whatsapp or call me on my phone. 

If something is important, email me. It gives me the chance to better focus on your answer. 


## How do I prefer to communicate?
I'm not good with chit-chat. 
I'm not a big fan of recurring meetings. 
I care about people and I also want to get to the point quickly.

I work with 'unread' flag of messages and emails. in a very small fraction of these, the flag goes wrong and I assume I already processed a message when actualy I did not. 
When you did not hear from me, it would help me if you would ping me again. By default I respond to everything.



## When am I available?
I work inthe CEST timezone between 9.10 and 18.10 on weekdays. 
I try to be as avialable as possible for my colleagues in Vietname as much as possible between 9.10 and 13.00 CEST.

## Work-related topics you can discuss with me

Since I am one of the oldest members of INFOdation, and I see a lot of projects, you can ask me about anything work-related.
When there is a more specialized person available to discuss with, then taht is a better option for you.
- IT Architectue and Design of past, current and future systems.
- Product and partner selection
- Interesting(!) customer questions
- Fiber networks
- Single sign-on
- Cloud computing
- AI & LLM
- SonarCube
- GitHub
- Hermes
- design patterns
- performance review
- 


## Non-work related topics I like to talk about

I'ma bit of a work-aholic, soo not too many topics.

Do you have an all-road or supermoto motorcycle for sale? 

Know of a sailing-trip that needs another member? 



## Things you should know about me

To my non-ending annoyane I am very bad with people's names. This does __not__ mean I think you're not important or that I forgot about you.

Try forcing me to do something / anything will fail and result in a (sometimes strong) negative reaction.

I always try to improve myself and therefore I welcome constructive feedback.
